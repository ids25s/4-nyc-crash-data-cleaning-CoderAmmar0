# Context

## Overview

The Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset contains details on crashes in NYC. Each 
row represents a crash event reported by the NYPD. The data includes 
occurrences of injuries, fatalities, and location details. Reports are required
when an injury, fatality, or at least $1000 in damage occurs.

## Historical Context

The NYPD launched TrafficStat in 1998 to track fatal incidents. In 1999, the 
Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) improved data collection. Vision Zero
began in 2014 to reduce fatalities, and in 2016, FORMS replaced TAMS, allowing 
officers to record crash data electronically.

# Solving Questions

## Part A
1. Use the filter on the website to obtain crash data for the week of June 30, 2024, in CSV format.
   
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and run to create data directory:
     ```{bash}
     mkdir data
     ```

3. Navigate to your downloads folder and move the file to `data/`:
     ```{bash}
     mv "C:\Users\Ammar\Downloads\Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes_06302024.csv" data/
     ```

4. Rename the file to make it more informative:
     ```{bash}
     mv data/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes_06302024.csv 
        data/nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20240916.csv
     ```

5. Commit the data directory to repo:
     ```{bash}
     git add data/
     git commit -m "Added data directory"
     git push origin main
     ```

## Part B
Clean up the variable names. Use lower cases and replace spaces with underscores.

Standardizing column names improves data consistency and simplifies 
manipulation. I convert names to lowercase and replace spaces with 
underscores for easier access and readability.


```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = "C:/Users/Ammar/ids-s25/4-nyc-crash-data-cleaning-CoderAmmar0/data/nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20250212.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Convert column names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(" ", "_")

# Display cleaned column names
df.columns
```

## Part C
Check the crash date and time to see if they really match the filter we intented. Remove the extra rows if needed.

```{python}
# Checking the unique crash dates
unique_crash_dates = df["crash_date"].unique()

# Display unique crash dates
unique_crash_dates
```

Seems like the following Sunday is included in the dataset(7/07) so I will remove it.
```{python}

# Filter out crashes that occurred on 07/07/2024
df = df[df["crash_date"] != "07/07/2024"]

# Checking the unique crash dates again
unique_crash_dates_filtered = df["crash_date"].unique()

# Display the updated unique crash dates
unique_crash_dates_filtered
```

## Part D
Get the basic summaries of each variables: missing percentage; descriptive statistics for continuous variables; frequency tables for discrete variables.
```{python}

import numpy as np

# Calculate missing percentage for each column
missing_percentage = df.isnull().sum() / len(df) * 100

# Get descriptive statistics for continuous variables
continuous_vars = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).describe()

# Get frequency tables for discrete (categorical) variables
categorical_vars = df.select_dtypes(include=['object'])
frequency_tables = {col: categorical_vars[col].value_counts() for col in categorical_vars.columns}

# Create a DataFrame for missing percentages
missing_df = pd.DataFrame(missing_percentage, columns=["missing_percentage"])

# Display the missing percentage summary
print("Missing Percentage Summary:")
print(missing_df)

# Display descriptive statistics for continuous variables
print("\nDescriptive Statistics for Continuous Variables:")
print(continuous_vars)

# Display frequency tables for categorical variables
print("\nFrequency Tables for Categorical Variables:")
for col, freq_table in frequency_tables.items():
    print(f"\n{col}:\n{freq_table}")
```
Looking at the dataset, I noticed that many columns have missing values, 
especially for borough (28%), cross street names (49%), and off-street names 
(71%). There are also a lot of missing entries for contributing factors and 
vehicle types beyond the second vehicle, which suggests that most crashes 
involved only one or two vehicles. This could make it harder to analyze 
multi-vehicle crashes accurately.

In terms of injuries, most crashes didn’t result in fatalities, but injuries 
were fairly common, with motorists being the most affected, followed by 
pedestrians and cyclists. Brooklyn had the highest number of crashes, and 
driver inattention/distraction was the most frequently reported cause, though 
many records simply list "Unspecified." Sedans and SUVs were by far the most 
common vehicle types involved in crashes, which makes sense given their high 
presence on NYC roads.

It seems like the dataset has some gaps in reporting, which could affect 
deeper analysis and limit the accuracy of certain insights.


## Part E
Are their invalid longitude and latitude in the data? If so, replace them with NA.

Lets check for blank and 0 values:
```{python}
# Check for null values in latitude and longitude columns
null_lat_long = df[['latitude', 'longitude']].isnull().sum()

# Check for zero values in latitude and longitude columns
zero_lat_long = (df[['latitude', 'longitude']] == 0).sum()

# Display results
null_lat_long, zero_lat_long
```
There is 117 rows with blank values and 3 with values of 0 so lets replace them.
```{python}
# Replace zero values and blank values with "NA" 
df.loc[df['latitude'] == 0, 'latitude'] = "NA"
df.loc[df['longitude'] == 0, 'longitude'] = "NA"
df.loc[df['latitude'].isnull(),'latitude'] = "NA"
df.loc[df['longitude'].isnull(), 'longitude'] = "NA"

# Check for the number of "NA" values in latitude and longitude columns
na_lat_long_count = ((df['latitude'] == "NA") | (df['longitude'] == "NA")).sum()

# Display the count of "NA" values
na_lat_long_count

```
## Part F
Are there zip_code values that are not legit NYC zip codes? If so, replace them with NA

Lets check for blank values:
```{python}
# Check for null values in zip_code column
null_zip_code_count = df['zip_code'].isnull().sum()

# Display the number of null zip code values
null_zip_code_count

```

There is 477 blank values so lets replace them.

```{python}
# Replace null values in zip_code column with "NA" 
df.loc[df['zip_code'].isnull(), 'zip_code'] = "NA"

# Check if the null values were replaced by "NA"
na_zip_code_count = (df['zip_code'] == "NA").sum()

# Display the count of "NA" 
na_zip_code_count

```

## PART G
Are there missing in zip_code and borough? Do they always co-occur?

```{python}
# Check if zip_code is "NA" and borough is null (Since we didn't change it yet to NA)
missing_both_together = (df['zip_code'] == "NA") & df['borough'].isnull()

# Count rows where zip_code is "NA" and borough is null
missing_both_together_count = missing_both_together.sum()

missing_both_together_count

```
They seem to co-occur, lets replace null values with NA for borough:

```{python}
# Replace null values in borough column with "NA" 
df.loc[df['borough'].isnull(), 'borough'] = "NA"

# Check if the null values were replaced by "NA"
na_borough_count = (df['borough'] == "NA").sum()

# Display the count of "NA" 
na_borough_count
```

## Part H
Are there cases where zip_code and borough are missing but the geo codes are not missing? If so, fill in zip_code and borough using the geo codes.

```{python}
missing_zip_borough_geo_non_missing = ((df['zip_code'] == "NA") & 
                                       (df['borough'] == "NA") & 
                                       (df['latitude'] != "NA") & 
                                       (df['longitude'] != "NA"))

# Count rows where zip_code and borough are "NA" but geo codes are not missing
missing_zip_borough_geo_non_missing_count = missing_zip_borough_geo_non_missing.sum()

# Display the count of such cases
missing_zip_borough_geo_non_missing_count

```

Seems like 370 cases have the geo location values so lets update them.
```{python}

from opencage.geocoder import OpenCageGeocode
import time
# OpenCage API Key 
OPENCAGE_API_KEY = "8aad513ae943450db91e1c27f80a08ea"
geocoder = OpenCageGeocode(OPENCAGE_API_KEY)

# Ensure latitude and longitude are numeric (convert and handle errors)
def convert_to_float(value):
    try:
        return float(value)
    except ValueError:
        return None  # Return None for invalid values

df['latitude'] = df['latitude'].apply(convert_to_float)
df['longitude'] = df['longitude'].apply(convert_to_float)

# Function for reverse geocoding using only "county" and mapping it to borough names
def get_location_info(lat, lon, retries=3, delay=2):
    if lat is None or lon is None:  # Skip if invalid coordinates
        return "NA", "NA"
    
    for _ in range(retries):
        try:
            result = geocoder.reverse_geocode(lat, lon)
            if result:
                components = result[0]["components"]
                zip_code = components.get("postcode", "NA")
                
                # Extract county from OpenCage response
                county = components.get("county", "NA")

                # Map county names to boroughs
                borough_map = {
                    "New York County": "Manhattan",
                    "Kings County": "Brooklyn",
                    "Bronx County": "Bronx",
                    "Queens County": "Queens",
                    "Richmond County": "Staten Island"
                }
                borough = borough_map.get(county, county)  # Convert county to borough name if applicable
                
                return borough, zip_code
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}, retrying...")
            time.sleep(delay)
    
    return "NA", "NA"

# Find rows where ZIP code and borough are missing but latitude/longitude are available
missing_geo = (df['zip_code'] == "NA") & (df['borough'] == "NA") & df['latitude'].notnull() & df['longitude'].notnull()

# Apply reverse geocoding
for index, row in df.loc[missing_geo].iterrows():
    borough, zip_code = get_location_info(row['latitude'], row['longitude'])
    df.at[index, 'borough'] = borough  # Store mapped borough
    df.at[index, 'zip_code'] = zip_code

#Check the data if changed
df.head(20)
```
### Filling Missing Boroughs and ZIP Codes

I initially tried filling missing boroughs and ZIP codes using latitude and 
longitude by matching existing values within the dataset or using a geocoding 
API. However, multiple challenges made this more complex than expected.

### First Attempt: Dataset Mapping

I rounded latitude and longitude to two decimal places and used the most 
frequent ZIP code and borough for each coordinate pair. While this worked in 
some cases, issues arose:

- Some lat/lon points mapped to multiple ZIP codes, causing incorrect 
  assignments.
- Certain locations were missing entirely in the dataset.
- The most frequent ZIP code wasn't always accurate.

### Second Attempt: Nominatim API

I then used the Nominatim API (OpenStreetMap's geocoder), but it had issues:

- Slow response times and frequent timeouts.
- Rate limits blocked requests after a few queries.

### Third Attempt: OpenCage Geocoder

OpenCage was more stable, but it labeled boroughs as counties, returning only 
"New York" for many locations. However, I found that boroughs were stored 
under "county," which led to the final solution.

### Final Fix: Using County Data

I extracted the "county" field and mapped it to boroughs:

- New York County → Manhattan
- Kings County → Brooklyn
- Bronx County → Bronx
- Queens County → Queens
- Richmond County → Staten Island

This method successfully assigned missing boroughs and ZIP codes accurately.

### Lessons Learned

- Internal dataset mapping can help but has limitations.
- API responses vary in format, requiring careful inspection.
- Rate limits and timeouts need handling when using geocoders.
- Sometimes, useful data exists in unexpected fields, like "county" instead of 
  "borough."

Despite unexpected challenges, this approach provided a reliable way to fill 
in missing boroughs and ZIP codes.


## Part I
Is it redundant to keep both location and the longitude/latitude at the NYC Open Data server?

Storing both location and latitude/longitude can be redundant since location 
is derived from the other two. However, keeping it improves usability for 
different users and tools. Removing location would save space, but retaining 
it adds convenience for analysis and accessibility.


## Part J
Check the frequency of crash_time by hour. Is there a matter of bad luck at exactly midnight? How would you interpret this?

```{python}
# Convert crash_time to datetime format to extract hour
df['crash_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['crash_time'], format='%H:%M', errors='coerce')

# Extract hour from crash_time
df['crash_hour'] = df['crash_time'].dt.hour

# Count occurrences of crashes by hour
crash_hour_counts = df['crash_hour'].value_counts().sort_index()

crash_hour_counts 
```

The spike in crashes at midnight (00:00) is likely due to fatigue, nightlife-
related driving, shift changes, and potential data entry defaults. The 
increase around 16:00 (4 PM) may be linked to the afternoon rush hour and 
workers heading home. Both times indicate higher-risk driving conditions.

## Part K
Are the number of persons killed/injured the summation of the numbers of pedestrians, cyclist, and motorists killed/injured? If so, is it redundant to keep these two columns at the NYC Open Data server?

```{python}
# Check if the total number of persons killed is the sum of pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists killed
df["calculated_persons_killed"] = (
    df["number_of_pedestrians_killed"].fillna(0) +
    df["number_of_cyclist_killed"].fillna(0) +
    df["number_of_motorist_killed"].fillna(0)
)

df["calculated_persons_injured"] = (
    df["number_of_pedestrians_injured"].fillna(0) +
    df["number_of_cyclist_injured"].fillna(0) +
    df["number_of_motorist_injured"].fillna(0)
)

# Check if the values match the provided total persons killed/injured columns
killed_match = (df["calculated_persons_killed"] == df["number_of_persons_killed"]).all()
injured_match = (df["calculated_persons_injured"] == df["number_of_persons_injured"]).all()

killed_match, injured_match

```

The "persons killed" column matches the sum of pedestrians, cyclists, and 
motorists killed, but the "persons injured" column does not fully align. This 
may indicate data inconsistencies or additional factors. NYC Open Data may 
retain these columns for validation, easier aggregation, or quick access to 
totals. The mismatch in injuries suggests both columns provide useful 
information.

## Part L
Print the whole frequency table of contributing_factor_vehicle_1. Convert lower cases to uppercases and check the frequencies again.

 ```{python}
 
# Print the entire frequency table
print(df["contributing_factor_vehicle_1"].value_counts().to_string())

 ```

 Now changing to Uppercase:
 ```{python}
 # Convert values in "contributing_factor_vehicle_1" to uppercase
df["contributing_factor_vehicle_1"] = df["contributing_factor_vehicle_1"].astype(str).str.upper()

# Print the entire frequency table
print(df["contributing_factor_vehicle_1"].value_counts().to_string())

 ```
The most common contributing factor in crashes is "UNSPECIFIED" (423 cases), 
followed by "DRIVER INATTENTION/DISTRACTION" (404 cases) and "FAILURE TO YIELD 
RIGHT-OF-WAY" (109 cases). This suggests that inattentiveness and failure to 
follow right-of-way rules are significant contributors to accidents, while 
many cases lack specific attributions.


## Part M
 Provided an opportunity to meet the data provider, what suggestions would you make based on your data exploration experience?
If I had the chance to meet the data provider, I would recommend:

- Reducing Missing or Unspecified Data: Encouraging detailed reporting 
and refining data collection methods could improve accuracy.
- Clarifying Injury Data: Investigating why total injuries don't fully 
match pedestrian, cyclist, and motorist counts could enhance reliability.
- Standardizing Formatting: Enforcing uniform capitalization and 
structured input methods would improve consistency in categorical data.
- Improving Location Accuracy: Addressing missing or incorrect latitude, 
longitude, and borough data would benefit spatial analysis.
- Providing Context on Data Collection: Clear documentation on how 
factors like injuries and contributing causes are determined would help 
analysts interpret data correctly.

These enhancements could improve data quality, making it more valuable for 
policy decisions and public safety initiatives.
